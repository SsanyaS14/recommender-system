This Project uses a collaborative filtering recommender system to predict True Vertical Depth(TVD). We are given two data sets of Wyoming and Norway. We must predict TVD for optimization of oil production in these areas. In this recommender system, we use matrix factorization, with the parameters depth and formation. Both of these factors are standardized before we use matrix factorization on one of the data sets. Additionally, we apply Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to the matrix factorization.
